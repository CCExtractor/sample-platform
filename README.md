# CCExtractor Sample Platform

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CCExtractor/sample-platform.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CCExtractor/sample-platform) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/CCExtractor/sample-platform/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/CCExtractor/sample-platform)

This repository contains the code for a platform that manages a test suite bot, sample upload and more. This platform allows for a unified place to
report errors, submit samples, view existing samples and more. It was
originally developed during GSoC 2015 and rewritten during GSoC 2016. During
GSoC 2017 it was further improved. Now, during GSoC 2018, it is again being
worked upon. 

To see the live version of the platform, simply go to
[CCExtractor Submission Platform](https://sampleplatform.ccextractor.org/).

## Concept

While CCExtractor is an awesome tool and it works flawlessly most of the time,
bugs occur occasionally (as with all existing software). These are usually
reported through a variety of channels (private email, mailing list, GitHub,
and so on...).

The aim of this project is to build a platform, which is accessible to
everyone ([after signing up](https://sampleplatform.ccextractor.org/account/signup)), that provides a single place to upload, view 
samples and associated test results.

stable and secure, bugs can occur. In case there is a security related issue,
