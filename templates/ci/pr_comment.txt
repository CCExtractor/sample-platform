<b>CCExtractor CI platform</b> finished running the test files on <b>{{platform}}</b>. Below is a summary of the test results:
<table>
<thead>
<td> Report Name </td>
<td> Tests Passed </td>
</thead>
{% for test in tests%}
<tr>
<td> {{test.category}} </td>
{% if test.success==None %}
<td> <b> 0/{{test.total}}  </b> </td>
{% elif test.success == test.total %}
<td> {{test.success}}/{{test.total}} </td>
{% else %}
<td> <b> {{test.success}}/{{test.total}} </b> </td>
{% endif %}
</tr>
{% endfor %}
</table>
{% if state == "failure" %}
It seems that not all tests were passed completely. This is an indication that the output of some files is not as expected (but might be according to you). 

Your PR breaks these cases:
<ul>
{% for test in failed_tests %}
<li> ccextractor {{ test.command }} <a href="{{ url_for('sample.sample_by_id', sample_id=test.sample.id, _external=True) }}">{{ test.sample.sha[:10] }}...</a> </li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
{% else %}
All tests were passed completely.
{% endif %}

Check the <a href="{{ url_for('test.by_id', test_id=test_id, _external=True) }}">result</a> page for more info.
